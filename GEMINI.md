### GEMINI.md - The Actual Workflow

This is not a traditional blog and does not use static site generators like Jekyll.

This is a **near-live travel journal**, managed by an AI (Lobby/Gemini) under Riccardo's direction.

**The process is very simple:**

1.  **Input:** Riccardo provides prompts, voice notes, photos, and corrections to Lobby via a chat interface.
2.  **Processing:** Lobby writes the Markdown content, processes images, and structures the daily journal files.
3.  **Publishing:** Lobby commits and pushes the changes directly to this repository.
4.  **Viewing:** Family and friends can read the updates in near real-time by viewing the `.md` files directly on GitHub.

There is no "site" to "build". What you see in the repository is the final product.
