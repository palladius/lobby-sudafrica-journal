We finally arrived in Johannesburg! 🛬

### Arrival
The trip started with a smooth landing around **10:30**. Here is our arrival photo at the airport!

By **11:00**, we picked up our rental car — absolutely beautiful! — and headed out towards the Pilanesberg.

### Kwa Maritane & Pancakes (15:00)
We arrived at the **Kwa Maritane Bush Lodge** around **15:00**. The welcome was fantastic: they made us delicious **fresh pancakes** right at the reception! Sebi approved. 🥞😋

*(Photo of pancakes incoming...)*

### Quick Dip in the Pool (15:45 - 16:15)
While mom was freshening up, we sneaked in a quick swim in the **heated pool** with Ale and Sebi. There was a slide, but the boys reported it was "very slow" and not particularly thrilling. 🐢💦

But in our imagination (and Lobby's render), that slide was EPIC!

### Afternoon Safari (16:30 - 19:30)

### The Animals (Real & Reimagined)
We saw some incredible wildlife. Lobby (our AI friend) helped us reimagine these moments with a bit of Pixar magic.

#### Zebras
Sebi and Ale were amazed by the zebras crossing right in front of us.

Ale wanted a special memory with the zebra, so here is the "Pixar" version where they are best friends:

#### Rhinos
The rhinos were majestic.

## Saturday, February 7, 2026: Cazzeggio al Kwa Maritane Bush Lodge e secondo safari

Today is about relaxing at the **Kwa Maritane Bush Lodge** and preparing for our second safari later!

### Morning Fun: Baby Chess ♟️ (11:10)
We found a giant chessboard in the garden! The boys immediately challenged each other to a game of "Baby Chess".

### The "Hide" 🕵️‍♂️ (10:02)
We also discovered a mysterious entrance labeled **"Hide"**. We ventured down into the tunnel... it was like a secret bunker!

The tunnel itself was long and mysterious...

Inside, there was a small viewing slit (about 20cm high) looking out onto a small pond and the forest. We waited breathlessly for animals to appear...
But alas, **buco nell'acqua** (a hole in the water)! No animals showed up this time. Still, a cool hiding spot. 🤷‍♂️

### 🦷 Milestone: The First "African" Tooth! (11:45)
Big news! **Alessandro lost his first "African" tooth!** 🦷🇿🇦
He proudly showed it off by the pool. The Tooth Fairy (or perhaps the "Safari Tooth Lion"?) will have to find him all the way down here!

Finished a relaxing massage, then lunch with Alessandro and Sebi.
Surprise outside the room: a group of curious baboons paid us a visit!
